# Cryptomining-Bocker
Cryptocurrencies are underpinned by a technology named blockchain. Blockchain is a
public ledger shared amongst a network of computers and consists of all transactions
that have taken place using a certain cryptocurrency. Transactions are validated and
stored in the blockchain through a process called CRYPTOMINING. It is a legitimate
new business where companies and individuals dedicate a considerable amount of CPU
power to cryptomining, an intensive process of computing and solving complicated
mathematical problems in order to earn a Proof of Work, or PoW, which verifies the next
block in the chain.?This problem requires significant computational power to be solved.
The node or group of nodes solving the problem first gets to add the latest batch of
completed transactions in the blockchain and receives a reward for the performed
computation (in cryptocurrency coins). Mining requires the use of special software for
solving the mathematical problem.

The technique of hijacking browsers for mining cryptocurrency is called "cryptojacking”.
Delivering cryptocurrency miners through malware is nothing new. Yet, mining
cryptocurrency when accessing a webpage is new and it has already been abused and
rapidly spread. The figure below illustrates how cyber criminals abuse cryptomining
scripts through cryptojacking. Cryptojacking also refers to legitimate websites that do
not explicitly ask visitors’ consent prior to executing cryptomining scripts in their
browsers, nor do they provide them the option to opt-out.
